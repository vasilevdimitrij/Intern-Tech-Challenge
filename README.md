I built this app for the primary purpose of showcasing my basic knowledge for the Intern Tech Challenge of Symphony in building Web Applications with JavaScript.

## Major Tools and Technologies Used in this Project

CSS (Styling the web pages)
JAVASCRIPT (Adding logic to the web application)
NODEJS (Server side Javascript)
